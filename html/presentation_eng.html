            <p>I am a serious and implicated student in my first year of Network and Telecoms BUT at the IUT of Ch√¢tellerault.</p>
            <p>As I'm in my first year, that let me more than 2 years to finish my studies and I will be a bachelor's degree +3 in Network and Telecoms.</p>

                <h1>School career</h1>
                <p>I had a basic schoolarship until high school where I choose to go in STI2D instead of going in general 11th grade, a path that I didn't liked that much.</p>
                <p>In my senior year, I decide to choose the speciality ITEC, where we mostly did mecanic.</p>
                <p>After obtaining the BAC mention Quite Well, i directed myself towards the Network and Telecoms BUT because, as we saw quickly some elements of network in STI2D, these last ones had liked me much.</p>

            <div id="futur">
                <h1>My future</h1>
                <p>Afted finishing my studies, I'm still hesitating to continue them to engineering school.</p>
                <p>I would like, if possible, to have a work/study training program to maximise my knowledge on theory and practice.</p>

        <div id="passion">
            <h1>My hobbies</h1>
            <p>
                Like many people, I have a passion for everything related to computers in general, a passion that my father also shares and that he 
                introduced to me at a very young age. I also love football, I played it for several years (from 4 to 16 years old) but I decided to stop, 
                now I simply watch. Doing sports is still a pleasure for me and in 2021 I discovered running which I have been doing (at an amateur level) 
                as soon as I can for almost 2 years now.
